## 0.8.1

- Short syntax for HTML widgets.
- Minor bug fixes in documentation.

## 0.8.0

### New

- Support for running multiple apps on the same page.
- Widget keys(`Key`, `LocalKey` and `GlobalKey`). (previously key was just a string)
- `AsyncRoute` and `EventDetector` widgets along with number of new HTML widgets.

### Changes

- All HTML widgets now has an `id` attribute.
- From now on, you've to use `runApp()` to bootstrap your apps. (see docs)
- Widget's keys are not String literals anymore. Use `Key`, `LocalKey`, or `GlobalKey`.
- `size` property has been removed from `Image` and `IFrame` widget.
- Getters `element` and `isRebuilding` has been removed from `StatefulWidget`.
- Following properties are changed:
    - `onClick` is renamed to `onClickAttribute`
    - `onClickEventListener` is renamed to `onClick`
    - `onInputEventListener` is renamed to `onInput`
    - `onChangeEventListener` is renamed to `onChange`
    - `onSubmitEventListener` is renamed to `onSubmit`
    - Signature for all `on*` callbacks has been changed to `void Function(EmittedEvent)`, previously it was `void Function (Event)`. `EmittedEvent` is a new type, compaitble with `Event`. 

- Minor changes to imports:
    - `import/rad/rad.dart` - Main library
    - `import/rad/widgets_html.dart` - Library that exports HTML widgets
    - `import/rad/widgets_async.dart` - Library that exports async widgets such as `FutureBuilder`
    - `import/rad/widgets_internals.dart` - Library that exports low-level types/objects.


### Core Changes

- Important additions to core are event delegation, element tree, batched DOM updates and a brand new algorithm for matching widgets during updates(new algorithm: `O(n)`, previous algorithm: `O(nÂ²)`). 

- A new widget `EventDetector` is also added that leverages core's event-delegation to allow you to register event listeners both in capture and bubbling phase. 

- `beforeMount` hook is now removed. Previously `render` hook gets called after `beforeMount` as widgets are using `render` hook to decorate their corresponding element in DOM. Now with batched DOM updates, widget will not be able to access actual element since mount will happen at a later stage.

- If a widget wants to decorate actual DOM element then it can optionally return a `ElementDescription` object which will be operated on real DOM element when DOM updates are dispatched. Similarly widget can return updated `ElementDescription` object on `update` hook.

## 0.7.0

### New

- ListView widget. Along with `ListView.builder` version that build items in a lazy fashion. This widget can be used to create infinite scrolling lists/pages.

### Changes

- key is now a named parameter. Use `super(key: key)` instead of `super(key)`
- Brought sanity to Navigator's values API. Now instead of passing values as string, use Map to pass values.

### Improvements

- Added Canvas widget for HTML's Canvas tag.

- Added `child` property to all MarkUp tag widgets.

- Added `didChangeDependencies` hook to StatefulWidget.

- Navigator:
    - Uri encoding/decoding for values passed.
    - Ability to look up specific instance in ancestors.
    - Fixed Uri replacement issue when app is installed under sub dir(path).

## 0.6.2

### New!

- Added InheritedWidget

### Changes

- 'App' widget has been renamed to 'RadApp'.
- StatelessProvider widget has been removed. Alternative: InheritedWidget 

### Core update

- Core is now able short-circuit widget rebuilds. This makes Rad a blazingly fast frontend framework.
- Now keys can be used to distinguish between correct widgets while rebuilding. Something like that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn0EOS-ZiIc
- From now, `const` contructors can drastically improves performance. Try to use them where possible.
    To get linter help on this, use following rules in your `analysis_options.yaml`
    ```yaml
    linter:
        rules:
            - prefer_const_constructors
            - prefer_const_declarations
            - prefer_const_constructors_in_immutables
            - prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables
    ```

## 0.5.4

- Patch Navigator initial Render

## 0.5.2

- Added innertText, onClick and onClickEventHanlder property for HTML tags.

## 0.5.1

- Update public API

## 0.5.0

### New widgets

- StatelessProvider
- HTML tag widgets
- FutureBuilder, StreamBuilder, ValueListenableBuilder

### Changes

- Following widgets are removed: Center, Align, Positioned, Center, Flex,
Row, Column, Stack, Spacer, Expanded, Flexible, Align, Container, SizedBox.

### Core Update

Major changes:

- Both Widgets and RenderObjects are now immutable
- Plus, A RenderObject is created exactly once.

For above two things, we've delegated some of the mutable parts to DOM
and a super lightweight widget configuration API is added that handles
mutability on widget's constructor level

Improvements:

- Added findAncestor* methods to BuildContext
- Navigator and GestureDetector are now subclassing StatefulWidget
- A lot of mess has been cleaned. Including 'late final' modifier combos
that has problems with dart2js. 

### Comments

A lot has been changed. We've now reached our first milestone. State management
that's required to build real world apps is complete. I'm currently going back 
to create web version of my Flutter app using this framework and see where it can
be improved.

## 0.4.0

### New widgets!

- Center widget for alignment.

- MarkUp widget that allows passing arbitrary content to DOM.

- SizedBox widget for creating a fixed size box.

- Row, Column, and Flex widgets for flex layout.

- Flexible and Expanded widgets for flex items.

- Spacer widget for adding extra space in flex layout.

- Navigator widget for Navigation and routing. 

    Navigator supports:
    - Auto Routing
    - Auto Deep linking
    - Single page application experience(no page reloads)
    
### Changes

- Removed Align.center() constructor. 'Center' is added as drop-in replacement.

- Removed Text widget's `isHtml` prop. Alternative: 'MarkUp' widget.

### Move toward less verbose syntax:

- Box size properties namely width, height, top, right, bottom, left, margin, padding accept only `String` values. 
- Explicit properties that deals with measurement unit such as "positionUnit" and "sizeUnit" are removed.

```dart
// previously
Container(
    width: 10,
    height: 20,
    sizeUnit: MeasuringUnit.percent
)

// now
Container(
    width: "10%",
    height: "20%",
)

// this can be done in a even more less verbose way
Container(
    size: "10% 20%",
)

// previously
Positioned(
    top: 10,
    left: 20,
)

// now
Positioned(
    top: "20px",
    left: "20px",
)

// or
Positioned(
    position: "20px _ _ 20px",
)

// syntax is
// position: "top right bottom left",
// values that are set to '_' will be skipped
```

This change brings three good things:

- Clean and less verbose code.
- Flexibility. Developer can set literally any value.
- Performance! since this also removes a lot of complexity on Framework side.

Please refer to "Size and Position" section of project's readme to learn more about these changes.  

### Small improvements

- Added `rebuildOnUpdate` hook to StatefulWidget. 

Previously StatefulWidget always ignore setState() or any change in state in parent tree. Now you can override rebuildOnUpdate hook and return true if you want to rebuild StatefulWidget when something changes in parent tree. Note, rebuilding won't dispose your widget, it'll simply call build() method of your StatefulWidget to get up-to-date interface, and update DOM if required. 

This hook helps a lot when you've a StatefulWidget in a Navigator's page, and you want to rebuild that widget when user comes back from a different page. Returning true from rebuildOnUpdate hook will make sure that end user isn't looking at a stalled interface.

## 0.3.0

### Update

- New shorthand `Align.center`. It has same semantics as of Flutter's `Center` widget.

- Container widget:
    - Added `margin` property, that let's you set margin around Container.
    - Added `padding` property, that let's you set padding space inside Container.

- Custom alignments for positioning a widget on desired locations.
    ```dart
    Align(
        alignment: Alignment(80, 40); // top 80% & left 40% 
        ...
    ```

### Changes

- `sizingUnit` is renamed to `sizeUnit`
- `positioninUnit` is renamed to `positionUnit`

### Core update

- Widget are now smart enough to issue changes to DOM only when required. Previously a widget always issue update to part of its interface that might or might not have affected by state change in parent because this is the easiest way to ensure that its corresponding DOM is always up-to-date. From now, widgets will issue updates to DOM only if their description has changed. 

    For example, in below code, Text widget will never issue a update no matter how many times you do toggle.

    ```dart
    Text(isClicked ? "hey" : "hey")
    ```
    
    This feature gets more effective in nested widgets. Take a look at another example,

    ```dart
    Align(
        alignment: isClicked ? Alignment.center : Alignment.center,
        child: Container(
            style: isClicked ? "red" : "red",
            child: Text(isClicked ? "hey" : "hey"),
        ),
    ),
    ```

    Above Align widget will affect DOM only once when its being built. It'll never issue a DOM update during rest of its lifetime.



## 0.2.1

### Update

- Allow creation of minified and optimized builds.

## 0.2.0

- Framework now allow Stateful widgets nested inside other stateful widgets to preserve their state even when their parent state has changed.

## 0.1.0

### Update

- Added: Overlay widget

### Changes

- GestureDetector
    - `onTapEvent` property is added in-place of `onTap`
    - `onTap` now handles `VoidCallback`s
