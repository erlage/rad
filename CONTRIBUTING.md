# Contributing
We're happy that you looking to contribute to this project. We don't want to impose any strict guidelines on "how things should be" but since there are people using Rad in production we can't accept anything as it as. Below is the little guide that's intended to answer questions that you might have.

## Opening Issues

- Avoid filing multiple bugs in a single issue.
- Use issues for bugs/feature-request/query.
- When raising an issue, please be as thorough as possible. For possible bugs, reproducible code is always a great sign.

## What can you work on?

- Anything that improves documentation(typos, read me)
- Anything from pending [Bugs](https://github.com/erlage/rad/labels/bug)
- Anything from pending [Enhancements](https://github.com/erlage/rad/labels/enhancement)
- Anything from pending [Feature requests](https://github.com/erlage/rad/labels/feature%20request)

If you want to work on something that's not in opened issues, just open an issue for it! and wait for someone to add label to your issue. Please do not take this the wrong way. This lets us avoid working on the same thing, or worse, someone putting in a lot of work for a pull request that does not fit into the scope of the project.

## What about Pull Requests?

- Avoid making big pull requests as they are difficult to review.
- A description on what has been fixed/improved/added will be appreciated.
- **Do not** add dependencies.

### Before you submit your code!

- Format your code(`dart format .`) with default settings.
- Run build runner(`dart run build_runner build`) with default settings.
