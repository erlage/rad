/// A widget that has mutable state.
///
/// A stateful widget is a widget that describes dynamic user interface.
/// Stateful widgets are useful when the part of the user interface you are
/// describing can change dynamically, e.g. due to having an internal
/// state, or depending on some system state.
///
/// ## Performance consideration
///
///   Rad uses a extremely lightweight yet powerful mechanism to build and
///   update DOM. Below are some general tips along with high level
///   understanding of how things works under the hood:
///
///
/// * Use const constructors where possible.
///
///
/// * Push the state to the leaves.
///   Having state at top level of application is acceptable as well but it's
///   worth noting that having less childs to update means updates can be
///   dispatched and processed faster.
///
///
/// * In mission critical situations you can override framework's diffing
///   process using [shouldUpdateWidget] & [shouldUpdateWidgetChildren], both
///   of which are present on every widget.
///   If you know that in some situations your widget doesnâ€™t need to update,
///   you can return false from [shouldUpdateWidget]. And by returning false
///   from [shouldUpdateWidgetChildren] you can prevent framework from going
///   down the widget and updating its child widgets. Remember! maintaining
///   [shouldUpdateWidget] & [shouldUpdateWidgetChildren] is hard so it's not
///   something you should be using everywhere.
///
///
/// * In worst case, framework rebuild widgets from scratch. Complete rebuild
///   involves disposing off current childs and rebuilding new ones with new
///   state. Usually happens when child that framework is looking for is not
///   there anymore because of state change in parent. Rebuilds might be bad if
///   Rad has to render pixel multiple times a second. Luckly in Rad, building
///   and updating interface is a one-step process. Framework handles the
///   description of widgets and building process is carried out by the browser.
///   We can rely on browsers for building big parts of tree when needed.
///   After all that's what they do. By widget description, we mean 'data'
///   that's required to build a widget. This means even if you remove child
///   nodes/or part of DOM tree using browser inspector, calling setState() in a
///   parent widget will bring back everything back in DOM.
///
///
/// ## A Stateful widget example: 'click to toggle'
///
/// ```
/// class ClickToggle extends StatefulWidget {
///
///   @override
///   _ClickToggleState createState() => _ClickToggleState();
/// }
///
/// class _ClickToggleState extends State<ClickToggle> {
///   bool isClicked = false;
///
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     return GestureDetector(
///       onTap: _handleTap,
///       child: Text(
///         isClicked
///             ? "on! click to turn off."
///             : "click to turn on."
///         ),
///     );
///   }
///
///   _handleTap() {
///     setState(() {
///       isClicked = !isClicked;
///     });
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [StatelessWidget], for widgets that always build the same way given a
///    particular configuration.

/// The logic and internal state for a [StatefulWidget].

/// It's called exactly once during lifetime of this widget.
///
///
/// 2. [State.build] - is called when framework wants to build interface for
/// widget.
/// Whatever interface(widgets) this method return will be built. Note that,

///
///
/// 3. [State.dispose] - is called when framework is about to dispose widget and

/// Apart from three main hooks, [State] has two additional hooks that
/// implementations can override when needed. These are,
///
///
/// [State.didUpdateWidget] - Called whenever the widget configuration changes.

/// [State.didChangeDependencies]- Called when a dependency of this [State]
/// object changes.
